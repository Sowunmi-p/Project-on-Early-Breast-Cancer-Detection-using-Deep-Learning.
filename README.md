The primary purpose of this code is to preprocess and analyze breast cancer cbis-ddsm and histopathology images, train various deep learning models (CNN, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, MobileNet), evaluate their performance, and compare their effectiveness in classifying breast cancer images into benign and malignant categories. The ultimate goal is to identify the most effective model for breast cancer detection using histopathological images.

2. **CSV Files**: CSV files containing image paths and corresponding labels.
3. **Hyperparameters**: Parameters for model training such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.

#### Outputs:
1. **Trained Models**: Saved models after training.
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score.
3. **Confusion Matrices**: Visual representation of the model's performance on test data.
